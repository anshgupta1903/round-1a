            "refined_text": "Customizing signature workflows using seed values Seed values offer additional control to document authors by letting them specify which choices signers can make when signing a document. By applying seed values to signature fields in unsigned PDFs, authors can customize options and automate tasks. They can also specify signature requirements for items such as certificates and timestamp servers. For more information about customizing signatures using seed values, see the Digital Signature Guide. Create the appearance of a certificate-based signature You determine the look of your certificate-based signature by selecting options in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box. For example, you can include an image of your handwritten signature, a company logo, or a photograph. You can also create different signatures for different purposes. For some, you can provide a greater level of detail. A signature can also include information that helps others verify your signature , such as the reason for signing, contact information, and more. 1. (Optional) If you want to include an image of your handwritten signature in the certificate-based signature, scan your signature, and save it as an image file. Place the image in a document by itself, and convert the document to PDF. 2. Right-click the signature field, and select Sign Document or Certify with Visible Signature. Note: You can also create an appearance using the Signature preferences: Hamburger menu > Preferences > Signatures (Windows) or Acrobat > Preferences > Signatures (macOS). 3. From the Appearance menu in the Sign dialog box, select Create New Appearance. 4. In the Configure Signature Appearance dialog box, type a name for the signature you\u2019re creating. When you sign, you select the signature by this name. Therefore, use a short, descriptive title. 5. For Configure Graphic, choose an option: No Graphic Displays only the default icon and other information specified in the Configure Text section. Imported Graphic Displays an image with your certificate-based signature. Select this option to include an image of your handwritten signature. To import the image file, select File, select Browse and then select the image file. Name Displays only the default signature icon and your name as it appears in your digital ID file. 6. For Configure Text, select the options that you want to appear in the signature. Distinguished Name shows the user attributes defined in your digital ID, including your name, organization, and country. 7. For Text Properties, specify the writing direction and type of digits used, and then click OK. See also Enable right-to-left languages. 8. (Optional) If the dialog box includes the Additional Signature Information section, specify the reason for signing the document, the location, and your contact information. These options are available only if you set them as your preferences in the Creation and Appearance Preferences dialog box (Preferences > Signatures > Creation & Appearance > More). Set up a roaming ID account A roaming ID is a digital ID that is stored on a server and can be accessed by the subscriber. You must have an Internet connection to access a roaming ID and an account from an organization that supplies roaming digital IDs. 1. Open the Preferences dialog box. 2. Under Categories, select Signatures. 3. For Identities & Trusted Certificates, select More. 4. Expand Digital IDs on the left, select Roaming ID Accounts, and select Add Account. 5. Type the name and URL for the roaming ID server, and select Next. 6. Type your user name and password, or follow the directions to create an account. Select Next, and then select Finish. Once the roaming ID is added, it can be used for signing or encryption. When you perform a task that uses your roaming ID, you\u2019re automatically logged in to the roaming ID server if your authentication assertion hasn\u2019t expired. PKCS#12 modules and tokens You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign documents in different roles or using different certification methods. Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access digital IDs from various locations. Register the digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use. Store certificates on directory servers Directory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an organization. The server acts as an ideal location to store user certificates in enterprises that use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a certificate, you can add it to your list of trusted identities so that you don\u2019t have to look it up again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup. For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide. Import directory server settings (Windows only) You import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security settings file. Before, you import settings in a file using import/export methodology, ensure that you trust the file provider before opening it. 1. Open the Preferences dialog box. 2. Under Categories, select Signatures. 3. For Document Timestamping, select More. 4. Select Directory Servers on the left, and then select Import. 5. Select the import/export methodology file and select Open. 6. Select the Signature Properties button to check the current signature status if the file is signed. 7. Select Import Search Directory Settings. 8. Select OK, if prompted to confirm your choice. The directory server appears in the Security Settings dialog box. Export directory server settings (Windows only) Although it is preferable to export security settings, you can export directory settings as an import/export methodology file. Use the file to configure the directory server on another computer. 1. Open the Preferences dialog box. 2. Under Categories, select Identity. 3. Enter your name, organization, and email address to create your profile. 4. Under Categories, select Signatures. 5. For Document Timestamping, select More. 6. Select Directory Servers on the left, and then select one or more servers on the right. 7. Select Export, select a destination, and then select Next. 8. To prove that the file came from you, select Sign, add your signature, and then select Next. 9. Do one of the following: \u2022 To save the file, specify its name and location, and select Save. \u2022 To send the file as an attachment, type an email address in the To box, select Next, and then select Finish. Note: See also Export security settings. Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures You can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a timestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature Properties dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing. Note: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one later to your signature. (See Establish long-term signature validation.) A timestamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server. Configure a timestamp server To configure a timestamp server, you need the server name and the URL, which you can obtain from an administrator or a security settings file. If you have a security settings file, install it and don\u2019t use the following instructions for configuring a server. Ensure that you obtained the security settings file from a trusted source. Don\u2019t install it without checking with your system administration or IT department. 1. Open the Preferences dialog box. 2. Under Categories, select Signatures. 3. For Document Timestamping, click More. 4. Select Time Stamp Servers on the left. 5. Do one of the following: \u2022 If you have an import/export methodology file with the timestamp server settings, click the Import button . Select the file, and select Open. \u2022 If you've a URL for the timestamp server, select the New button . Type a name, and then type the server URL. Specify whether the server requires a username and password, then select OK. Set a timestamp server as the default To be able to use a timestamp server to timestamp signatures, set it as the default server. 1. Open the Preferences dialog box. 2. Under Categories, select Signatures. 3. For Document Timestamping, click More. 4. Select Time Stamp Servers on the left. 5. Select the timestamp server, and click the Set Default button . 6. Select OK to confirm your selection."
